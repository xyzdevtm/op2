# MapGenerator

This is a go-based tool to generate map files for OpenFront.

The map generator reads PNG files and converts pixels into terrain based primarily on the **Blue** channel.
Because only blue values are used, grayscale and other formats are fully supported. Many maps in `assets/maps/<mapname>` are grayscale.

Additional Guides, Tutorials, Scripts, Resources, and Third Party Unofficial Applications can be found on
the [Official Openfront Wiki](https://openfront.wiki/Map_Making)

## Installation

1. Install go <https://go.dev/doc/install>
2. Go to map-generator folder: `cd map-generator`
3. Install dependencies: `go mod download`
4. Run the generator for all maps: `go run .`

## Creating a new map

Maps are discovered automatically from the `assets/maps/` folders — `info.json` holds everything the game needs to know about a map.

1. Create a new folder in `assets/maps/<map_name>`
2. Create `assets/maps/<map_name>/image.png`
3. Create `assets/maps/<map_name>/info.json` (see below)
4. Run the generator for your map: `go run . --maps=<map_name>`

   By default, `go run .` will process all defined maps.

   Use `--maps` to process a single map:

   `go run . --maps=fourislands`

   To process a subset of maps, pass a comma-separated list:

   `go run . --maps=northamerica,world`

5. Find the output folder at `../resources/maps/<map_name>`
6. Go back to the root directory: `cd ..`
7. Run Prettier: `npm run format`
   This rewrites ALL files in place. Git figures out which files are actually changed, don't worry.
   Alternatively, you can either run Prettier per file: `npx prettier --write resources/maps/<map_name>/<file_name>` or in VSCode install the Prettier extension and per file do Show and run Commands > Format Document.

Alternatively, `npm run gen-maps` (from the root directory) runs the generator for all maps and formats the output in one step.

## Output Files

- `../resources/maps/<map_name>/manifest.json` - JSON metadata containing map dimensions and land tile counts for all scales.
- `../resources/maps/<map_name>/map.bin` - Full-scale binary map data packed with terrain type and magnitude.
- `../resources/maps/<map_name>/map4x.bin` - 1/4 scale (half dimensions) binary map data used for mini-maps.
- `../resources/maps/<map_name>/map16x.bin` - 1/16 scale (quarter dimensions) binary map data used for mini-maps.
- `../resources/maps/<map_name>/thumbnail.webp` - WebP image thumbnail of the map.
- `../src/core/game/Maps.gen.ts` - Generated TypeScript (the `GameMapType` enum and the `maps` list of `MapInfo` objects) built from every map's info.json. Regenerated on every run, even with `--maps`.
- `../resources/lang/en.json` - The `map` section is rewritten with each map's display name. Regenerated on every run, even with `--maps`.

## Command Line Flags

- `--maps`: Optional comma-separated list of maps to process.
  - ex: `go run . --maps=world,eastasia,big_plains`

### Logging

- `--log-level`: Explicitly sets the log level.
  - ex: `go run . --log-level=debug`
  - values: `ALL`, `DEBUG`, `INFO` (default), `WARN`, `ERROR`.
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Adds additional logging and prefixes logs with the `[mapname]`. Alias of `--log-level=DEBUG`.
- `--debug-performance`: Adds additional logging for performance-based recommendations, sets `--log-level=DEBUG`.
- `--debug-removal`: Adds additional logging of removed island and lake position/size, sets `--log-level=DEBUG`.

The Generator outputs logs using `slog` with standard log-levels, and an additional ALL level.

The `--verbose`, `-v`, `--debug-performance`, and `--debug-removal` flags all set the log level to `DEBUG`.
`debug-performance` and `debug-removal` are opt-in on top of the debug log level, as they can produce wordy output. You must pass the specific flag to see the corresponding logs if the `log-level` is set to `DEBUG`.

Setting `--log-level=ALL` will output all possible logs, including all `DEBUG` tiers, regardless of whether the specific flags are passed.

## Create image.png

The map-generator will process your input file at `assets/maps/<map_name>/image.png` to generate the map
thumbnail and binary files. To create this `png` input file, you can crop the world map:

1. [Download world map (warning very large file)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W2oMPj1L5zWRyPhh8LfmnY3_kve-FBR2/view?usp=sharing)
2. Crop the file (recommend Gimp)

If you are doing work in image editing software or using automated tools, `./map_generator.go` contains documentation for:

- `Pixel` -> `Terrain Type & Magnitude` mapping in `GenerateMap`
- `Terrain Type` -> `Thumbnail Color` mapping in `getThumbnailColor`

### Impassable Terrain

Pure black pixels (`#000000` / `rgb(0, 0, 0)` with alpha ≥ 20) are encoded as **impassable terrain**. This is a solid, static void that:

- Cannot be owned, attacked, or nuked.
- Nuke trajectories cannot pass over it (just as they cannot leave the map border).
- Renders as the map background colour, making the map appear non-rectangular.

Use impassable terrain to carve out non-rectangular map shapes or to create barriers that divide regions without water.

In-Game, the color of a tile is determined dynamically based on its **Terrain Type** and **Magnitude**.

- Ocean default color definition: `../src/client/render/gl/render-settings.json` (user changeable via settings)
- Terrain color calculations: `../src/client/render/gl/utils/ColorUtils.ts#L50`

## Create info.json

The map-generator will process your input file at `assets/maps/<map_name>/info.json` to determine the
position of Nations, their starting coordinates, and any flags.

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "MySampleMap",
  "name": "My Sample Map",
  "translation_key": "map.mysamplemap",
  "categories": ["europe"],
  "multiplayer_frequency": 4,
  "nations": [
    {
      "coordinates": [396, 364],
      "name": "United States",
      "flag": "us"
    }
  ]
}
```

`coordinates` is x/y position of the nation spawn on the map. Origin is at top left, with x extending right and y extending down

`id` is the `CamelCaseName` of your map. It must match the `assets/maps/<map_name>` folder name (lowercased) and becomes the `GameMapType` enum key.

`name` is the map's canonical name — the `GameMapType` enum value. It must never change once the map ships (it is part of the wire format and stored in game records).

`display_name` (optional) is the English display name written to the `map` section of `../resources/lang/en.json`. It defaults to `name` — set it only when the display name should differ from the canonical name (e.g. `MENA`, `Europe (Classic)`).

`translation_key` is the key of the map's display name in `../resources/lang/en.json`. It must be `map.<map_name>`.

`categories` groups the map in the map picker. Each entry must be one of: `featured`, `continental`, `world`, `europe`, `asia`, `north_america`, `africa`, `south_america`, `oceania`, `antarctica`, `cosmic`, `tournament`, `fictional`, `arcade`. Maps that straddle regions (e.g. Black Sea, Bering Strait) can list more than one. Add `featured` to show the map in the featured section of the map picker.

`multiplayer_frequency` is how many times the map appears in the public multiplayer playlist. Use 0 (or omit) to keep the map out of the regular rotation.

`featured_rank` (optional, featured maps only) is the map's position in the featured grid (1 = first). Featured maps without a rank sort after ranked ones, alphabetically.

`special_team_count` (optional) is the map's preferred team count in team / special games — see `SPECIAL_TEAM_MAPS` in `../src/server/MapPlaylist.ts`. Omit it for no preference.

`flag` is the code for a country

- The full list of supported codes can be seen in `../src/client/data/countries.json` - all ISO_3166 codes are supported, with several additions.

- For quick reference, [Use country codes found here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes)

## Update CREDITS.md

Add License & Attribution information to `../CREDITS.md`. If you are unsure if
a map's license can be used, open an issue or ask in Discord before beginning work.

## Adding Flags

Flags can be added to `../resources/flags/<iso_code>.svg`

The country will need to be added to `../src/client/data/countries.json`

## To Enable In-Game

Everything is generated from the info.json files when the map-generator runs —
there are no manual steps:

- The `GameMapType` enum and the `maps` list (one `MapInfo` per map) are
  written to `../src/core/game/Maps.gen.ts`. Do not edit that file by hand.
- The `map` section of `../resources/lang/en.json` is rewritten with each
  map's `display_name` (or `name`). Translations to other languages are
  managed via Crowdin.

## Notes

- Islands smaller than 30 tiles (pixels) are automatically removed by the script.
- Bodies of water smaller than 200 tiles (pixels) are also removed.
- The map generator normalizes dimensions to multiples of 4. Any pixels beyond `Width - (Width % 4)` or `Height - (Height % 4)` are cropped.

For Performance Reasons:

- Maps should be between 2 - 3 million pixels square (area).
- Maps with over 3 million land tiles are not recommended.
- Average land tile count is around 1 - 2 million.

## 🛠️ Development Tools

- **Format map-generator code**:

  ```bash
  go fmt .
  ```

- **Output Map Generator Documentation**:

  ```bash
  go doc -cmd -u -all
  ```

  The map-generator is a cli tool, to get any visibility, we pass `-cmd`. It also
  does not expose any API, so we use `-u` and `-all` to show all documentation for
  unexposed values.

  _Known Bug_ Using `-http` does not respect the other flags and only renders the README
