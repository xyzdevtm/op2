[OpenFront.io](https://openfront.io/) is an online real-time strategy game focused on territorial control and alliance building. Players compete to expand their territory, build structures, and form strategic alliances in various maps based on real-world geography.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Strategy Gameplay**: Expand your territory and engage in strategic battles
- **Alliance System**: Form alliances with other players for mutual defense
- **Multiple Maps**: Play across various geographical regions including Europe, Asia, Africa, and more
- **Resource Management**: Balance your expansion with defensive capabilities
- **Cross-platform**: Play in any modern web browser

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v10.9.2 or higher)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openfrontio/OpenFrontIO.git
   cd OpenFrontIO
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm run inst
   ```

   Do NOT use `npm install` nor `npm i` but instead use our `npm run inst`. It runs the safer `npm ci --ignore-scripts` to install dependencies exactly according to the versions in `package-lock.json` and doesn't run scripts. This can prevent being hit by a supply chain attack.

## 🎮 Running the Game

### Development Mode

Run both the client and server in development mode with live reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:

- Start the webpack dev server for the client
- Launch the game server with development settings
- Open the game in your default browser (to disable this behavior, set `SKIP_BROWSER_OPEN=true` in your environment)

### Client Only

To run just the client with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run start:client
```

### Server Only

To run just the server with development settings:

```bash
npm run start:server-dev
```

### Connecting to staging or production backends

Sometimes it's useful to connect to production servers when replaying a game, testing user profiles, purchases, or login flow.

> To replay a production game, make sure you're on the same commit that the game you want to replay was executed on, you can find the `gitCommit` value via `https://api.openfront.io/game/[gameId]`.
> Unfinished games cannot be replayed on localhost.

To connect to staging api servers:

```bash
npm run dev:staging
```

To connect to production api servers:

```bash
npm run dev:prod
```

## 🛠️ Development Tools

- **Format code**:

  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

- **Lint code**:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Lint and fix code**:

  ```bash
  npm run lint:fix
  ```

- **Testing**
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- `/src/client` - Frontend game client
- `/src/core` - Deterministic game simulation
- `/src/server` - Backend game server
- `/resources` - Static assets (images, maps, etc.)
- `/panel` - Panel backend (Express + MongoDB)
- `/panel-ui` - Panel frontend (React + Tailwind)
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard

## 🎮 Custom Panel System

### Architecture

```
Game Client (9000) → Vite Proxy → Game Server (3000) → PanelProxy → Panel Backend (4000) → MongoDB
Panel UI (4001) ────────────────────────────────────→ Panel Backend (4000) → MongoDB
```

### Connection Flow (Game ↔ Panel)

1. **Session Sharing**: Both game server and panel backend use the same MongoDB (`openfront`) and same `SESSION_SECRET`. The PanelProxy forwards `connect.sid` cookies between them.

2. **JWT Authentication**: Game server issues EdDSA JWTs with `jti: crypto.randomUUID()`. The `TokenPayloadSchema` uses base64url-encoded `sub` field.

3. **Login Flow**: User clicks "Login to Panel" → panel login → panel session created → "Back to Game" → game server reads session via PanelProxy → returns user data + JWT.

4. **Stats Sync**: After each match, `archive()` saves GameRecord and updates `User.stats` in MongoDB. Both game server and panel read from the same DB.

### Key Components

| Component | Port | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Game Client (Vite) | 9000 | Dev server with WebSocket proxy |
| Game Server | 3000 | Main game logic + PanelProxy |
| Panel Backend | 4000 | Express + MongoDB API |
| Panel UI | 4001 | React dashboard |
| Admin Panel | 4002 | Admin dashboard |

### Test Accounts

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| admin | admin123 | admin |
| test | test123 | user |
| player2 | test123 | user |
| player3 | test123 | user |

### Running the System

```bash
# Game server + client
cd OG && npm run dev

# Panel backend
cd OG/panel && npm run dev

# Panel UI
cd OG/panel-ui && npm run dev
```

### Stats System

- **Collection**: Stats accumulated during gameplay in `StatsImpl`
- **Storage**: `archive()` saves GameRecord + updates User.stats in MongoDB
- **Display**: AccountModal shows stats from User collection; GameRecord provides detailed per-game stats
- **Winner Detection**: Auto-determines winner from active players when game ends
